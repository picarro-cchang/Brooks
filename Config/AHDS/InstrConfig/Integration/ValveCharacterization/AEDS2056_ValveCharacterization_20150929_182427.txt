Opening cavity to atmospheric pressure.
Inlet valve control started, pressure setpoint = 900.00, outlet valve DAC = 0.00
At atmospheric pressure 762.387 torr.
Current valve control mode: Manual Control
Starting outlet leak test.
Outlet leak test (5 minute duration). Pressure change in 1 minute = -1.084.
Stepping outlet valve to find when it opens.
Outlet valve just opens at 26500.
