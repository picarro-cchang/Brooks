[TASKS]
# Global settings
# Gas_HTML - Surrogate gas name with styling for titles, instructions,
#   and widgets.
# Recommended_Gas_Concentrations_PPM - The introduction text list
#   three recommended gas concentrations for an effective linear
#   regression test. The actual numbers that appear in the text are
#   are set with this key.    
# GasDelayBeforeMeasureSeconds - Wait N seconds after introducing the gas,
#   allowing enough time to equilibrate.  Must be determined empirically
#   for each analyzer type.
# GaseMeasureSeconds - How many seconds to measure a gas once the
#   equilibration time has finished.
# Pre_Task_Delay_Sec - How many seconds to display instructions (such
#   as switching a gas tank) before the main task starts.  If the delay
#   is long, the user can proceed by clicking NEXT.  If this key is
#   missing, the default is 1e10 seconds, about 31 years and the
#   progress bar will go into busy indication mode.
# Post_Task_Delay_Sec - Similar to Pre_Task_Delay but here we display
#   what should be done after a measurement, such as closing a reference
#   gas tank.
# Data_Source - In the data broadcast dictionary, the KEY of the sub-dict
#   containing the desired data stream (e.g. "sensors" or "analyze_H2CO2")
# Data_Key - The KEY in the data stream pointing to the exact data
#   needed for validation.
# Data_Key_Name - The name of the data as it appears in the GUI text and
#   plot labels.
# Secondary_Data_Key - [OPTIONAL] One or more data keys of data to
#   display in the plot labels.  This data isn't used except for
#   the display.
# Secondary_Data_Key_Names - [OPTIONAL] The name of the data as it will
#   appear in the GUI.
