# SOURCE       : Data source and label 
# SLOPE        : Calibration slope used to convert measured values to analog output units

# MIN          : Min output value (voltage -10 to 10)
# MAX          : Max output value (voltage -10 to 10)

# Note: for H20 output, units are not voltages but percentage scale (0-1).
