## This is a master mode definition file.
##
## Things to specify are:
##   AVAILABLE_MODES
##     - the available mode names
##     - there must be <mode_name>.mode files for each mode
##     - Search path for the files starts from the location of this file
##   Default configurations for all modes
##     - All other section headers are treated as if they are in each of
##       the independent .mode files
##     - If a section exists here AND in a specific mode file, the settings
##       in the mode file override these defaults

[SPECTRUM_IDS]
#Specify logical names for referencing each SubSchemeID...
HF = 60
O2 = 61

# Default processing to use for any spectra/label can be supplied below.
# - If the spectrum name is not referred to in the plan file for the active mode, the processing
#   indicated below will be used.
#   - This is particularily convenient for occasionally inserted spectra (such as Cal spectra)
#     that can occur in any mode.
# - If no processing is indicated here OR in the plan file for the mode, an error will be raised.
