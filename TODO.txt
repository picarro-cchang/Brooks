1. Check over-current flag in DSP and place instrument in safe mode.
2. Print out reason for sentry breach in log.
3. Support laser tuning mode.
4. In DAS, allow a way of detecting which schemes are valid and which virtual lasers have been defined.
5. Set up WLM dark currents as offsets
6. Return laser current and temperature controllers to manual mode when scheming stops.
7. Look at implementing averaging of metadata at ringdown, rather than just taking the last value.
