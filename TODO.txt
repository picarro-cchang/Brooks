3. Support laser tuning mode.
4. In DAS, allow a way of detecting which schemes are valid and which virtual lasers have been defined.
5. Set up WLM dark currents as offsets
6. Return laser current and temperature controllers to manual mode when scheming stops.
9. Tell Alex the units of pressure on the RingdownEntry queue (50*torr)
10. Deal with SPECTRUM_IGNORE_MASK
11. Note that max targetting error in hot box calibration is now in RADIANS. 1 cm^-1 is approx 4 radians
12. Support four-way switch with XC9536XL CPLD.
15. Add logic to protect cavity if pump is not turned on.
16. Calculate optimal update factor for WLM calibration.
17. Tell Carl about labelling of WB Heastsink thermistor on WLM board, Heater/TEC on power board.
18. Check for end of scheme file in reader

DONE
7. Look at implementing averaging of metadata at ringdown, rather than just taking the last value.
    - We now do linear extrapolation to the time of the ringdown.

8.  Check that we implement the increment flag for the subscheme Id as follows:
    a) If the flag is set, increment the count after the last ringdown of that row, whether or not the ringdown is successful
        and whether or not a timeout has caused us to short-circuit the row
    b) If the flag is not set but the scheme ends, increment the count.
    c) If stop spectrum is sent and there have been some ringdowns since the last "stop spectrum", increment the count.

13. Implement PZT offsets per virtual laser.
2. Print out reason for sentry breach in log.
14. Modify results viewer to read timestamp column, if it exists.
1. Check over-current flag in DSP and place instrument in safe mode.
