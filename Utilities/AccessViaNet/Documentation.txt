1. The utility c:/Picarro/G2000/AccessViaNet/AccessViaNet.exe provides limited remote access to the analyzer across a network. This utility should 
    be started up when Windows starts up by placing a shortcut to the batch file c:/Picarro/G2000/AccessViaNet/AccessViaNetStarter.bat in the Windows 
    startup folder. A configuration file, usually called c:/Picarro/G2000/AccessViaNet/AccessViaNet.ini is used to control the operation of the 
    utility.

2. To obtain data from the analyzer, connect via TCP/IP to port 8000. To issue analyzer commands, connect via TCP/IP to port 23. These ports and
     the masks which specify which hosts which are allowed to connect to the analyzer may be specified using the TCPcontrol and TCPdata options 
     in the [Addresses] section of the configuration file.

3. The data consists of comma separated fields. The first three fields are fixed, but up to fourteen additional fields may be specified 
    in the file AccessViaNet.ini. A typical output stream appears as follows:

    PICARRO,20111216T190750.000,3,140.01273,45.00094,45.00106,40.31250,31000.00000,31998.91797,42851.18359,41398.55078,45.99374,15.76092,13.17571
    PICARRO,20111216T190755.000,3,140.00650,45.00079,45.00115,40.31250,31000.00000,31997.85156,43101.12891,41423.71094,45.98952,15.75369,12.97711
    PICARRO,20111216T190800.000,3,140.00607,45.00085,45.00103,40.31250,31000.00000,31999.25391,42907.09766,41532.25781,45.98537,15.80056,13.20892
    PICARRO,20111216T190805.000,3,139.98329,45.00063,45.00115,40.31250,31000.00000,31991.97266,43201.66016,41442.14844,45.98116,15.76876,13.37075        
    
    The first field is the identification of the analyzer, which is specified by the Id option in the [InstrumentName] section of the configuration 
        file.
    The second field is the UTC (GMT) timestamp. The eight digits before the letter T denote the year, month and day, and the digits following denote
        the hour, minute and seconds.
    The third field consists of three bits. The least significant bit is always 1, indicating that the analyzer is turned on. The next bit (value 2)
        is one when sensor data are being reported, while the bit with value 4 is one when concentration data are being reported. In the example, the
        value 3 = 2+1 indicates that the analyzer is on and reporting sensor data.
    The subsequent fields are specified by the sections [SensorReport] and [DataReport] in the configuration file. 
        
4. The analyzer can be in one of three operating states. 
    During normal operation, it is in the measuring state, during which it reports concentration data.
    Before measurements start, it is in the warming state, during which it reports sensor data, typically at a slow rate.
    If the low-level analyzer software is not running, a one-second heartbeat is generated with only the three fixed fields available.
    
5. In the [DataReport] section of the configuration file, the Source option selects one of the data sources available in the analyzer. For the 
    flux analyzer, the two sources available are analyze_flux and FluxSync. The first of these sources reports concentrations as soon as they 
    become available, typically on an irregularly sampled grid of times. On the other hand, the FluxSync source reports concentrations linearly
    interpolated onto a regular 10Hz grid. The options Data1, Data2 etc. specify which variables are to be output. The names of the variables 
    available depends on the source. For example, if this section reads:
    
    [DataReport]
    Source = FluxSync
    Data1 = ch4_conc_sync
    Data2 = co2_conc_sync
    Data3 = h2o_conc_sync
    
    then the output stream when the instrument is in the measuring state might be:
    
    PICARRO,20111216T190750.000,5,1.89734,,1.627364
    PICARRO,20111216T190750.100,5,
    PICARRO,20111216T190750.200,5,
