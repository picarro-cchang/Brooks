Description: # async_hsm
        
        This framework for Asynchronous Hierarchical State Machines written in Python3 using 
        the asyncio module. It was forked from Dean Hall's farc project which is based on 
        Miros Samek's algorithm described in [QP](www.state-machine.com).
        [This book](https://newcontinuum.dl.sourceforge.net/project/qpc/doc/PSiCC2.pdf)
        describes QP and how to program hierarchical state machines.
        
        This framework has fewer than 1000 LOC.  It allows the programmer to create
        highly-concurrent programs by using a "message-passing" system and
        run-to-completion message handlers within a state-machine architecture.
        With these tools, complex, asynchronous operations are decomposed
        into managable chunks of code.
        
        In the paragraph above message-passing is in quotes because async_hsm is doing
        object reference copy and not object copy or serialization.
        This leaves the programmer open to nasty side-effects.
        For example, if you pass a list object and the recipient modifies the list,
        the sender experiences those modifications even after the message was passed.
        
        Known Issue: On windows, Ctrl+C is supressed by asyncio event loop's
        run_forever() ([bug report](https://bugs.python.org/issue23057)).
        The workaround is to inject an event to awake the event loop.
        
        
        ## Release History
        
        2019/09/28  0.2.1
        - Refactored timer events to make use of asyncio scheduling.
        
        - Allow state machines to be run with Python 3.7 asyncio.run which creates a
          new event loop.
        
        - Add internal _exit state and terminated attribute to the Hsm class and define
          Signal.ERROR and Signal.TERMINATE as built-in signals. 
        
        - Framework.stop() no longer stops the event loop but posts Signal.TERMINATE
          to all state machines. By default, the top state causes a transition to the 
          _exit state, in which the terminated attribute of the Hsm is set. When all
          state machines have their terminated attribute set, an asyncio.Event is set, 
          which is awaited by the static coroutine Framework.done().
        
        - Added run_async method to the Hsm class to allow an asynchronous task to be
          started within a state handler function.
        
        - Any exceptions in the state handlers or in an asynchronous task started by 
          run_async are caught and wrapped into an Event of type Signal.ERROR. The 
          payload of the event is a dictionary containing the exception object and a
          traceback. By default, error events are placed on the message queue of the
          state machine in which the error occured. In the top state, the default
          handler prints out the exception to the console, but does not change state.
          An attribute "publish_errors" of the Hsm may be set in order to publish 
          errors to the framework rather than to the individual state machines, which
          would then need to subscribe to the ERROR event to be notified.
        
        - Added example of using multiple Hsm in the Framework together with an 
          aiohttp based web server.
        
        2019/07/11  0.2.0
        - Renamed package as async_hsm. 
        
        - The algorithm for traversing the hierarchical state machine has been 
          rewritten so that it gives the same results as the comprehensive example
          in section 2.3.15 of "Practical UML statecharts in C/C++".
        
        - The state machine classes have been rewritten to use conventional methods 
          rather than static ones which require the state machine to be passed as 
          the first argument.
        
        - It is now possible to define state machines using a table-driven format.
          The examples Hsm_test.py and Hsm_test_tabled.py show how the same state
          machine may be entered in the two formats.
        
        2019/05/15  0.1.1
        - Removed 'initialState' argument from async_hsm.Hsm() constructor;
          framework now expects Hsm/Ahsm classes to have 'initial()' method.
        - Made state methods private in examples to demonstrate a best-practice.
        - Created async_hsm.Framework.run_forever() helper function.
        - Misc comment and doctring improvements
