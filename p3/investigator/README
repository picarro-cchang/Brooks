To run this code you will need some dependencies


sudo easy_install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
 pip install Flask

if you use venv you will need to make sure you add picarro pth to where the Host folder lives.  
  The Host folder is in a few of our repos and there will be more on this later. 


    touch /opt/picarro/investigator/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/picarro.pth

or

    touch /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/picarro.pth

After you have the .pth in proper location depending on your environment be sure to add the line like so where Host lives.

  
    /opt/picarro/szesurveyor

To verify this has worked you should run python shell and be sure you can import the modules

    python
    >>> import Host.Common

python AnalyzerServer/analyzerServer.py
