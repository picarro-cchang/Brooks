GUIDELINES FOR EDITS OF THE chemcorrect_inst.csv file:,
,1. The chemcorrect_inst.csv file is run sequentially from top to bottom.
,2. All columns to the right of those filled in the standard issued instruction file may be edited.
,3. Column A contains labels which can be edited.
,"4. When a label is edited, the new label must be placed everywhere the old label is throughout the file."
,"5. New labels can contain letters, numbers, underscores etc. but cannot contain spaces or mathematical characters (+,-,*,/ etc.)"
,6. All lists can be amended.
,7. Blank rows/columns are fine.
