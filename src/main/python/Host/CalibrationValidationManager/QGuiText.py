        <li>Up to four regulators (one for each cylinder being used). Each regulator should be capable of accurately delivering 2-3 psig (0.1-0.2 bar) of line pressure.</li>
        <li>Sufficient tubing to connect the regulator(s) to the instrument. We recommend using &frac14;" OD PTFE or PFA tubing.</li>
