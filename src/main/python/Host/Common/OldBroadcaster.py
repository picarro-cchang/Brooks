# File Name: Broadcaster.py
# Purpose: Broadcaster is a class which allows multiple clients to connect to a TCP socket and
#  receive data which is broadcasted to all of them. A client may disconnect at any time without
#  affecting the other clients. A buffer is established when each client connects, and contains
#  the data which the client has not yet received. If this buffer exceeds a certain length, the
#  connection to that client is automatically closed.
