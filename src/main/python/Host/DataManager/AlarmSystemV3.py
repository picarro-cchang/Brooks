class SingleAlarmMonitor:
    """
    Contains the low/high rule for one alarm sensor.

    The problem:
    When reporting alarm events or degradation of the health of the analyzer we need to
    avoid false alarms and information overload. When the condition is near the transition
    from green to yellow or red the indicator may flicker due to stochastic and temporary
    processes.  This condition is considered noise because in a large control room with
    many systems reporting it because difficult to identify the true urgencies.

    To only report yellow (may need service soon) or red (need service now or operational
    failure) conditions that are "real", a common practice is track the individual alarm
    events and only report a problem if a minimum number events occur in a specified time
    period.  Below is how we implement this idea.

    a) Input raw data. These data come out at irregular intervals depending on the source,
       ini settings, schemes, scripts, etc.  Some data is updated more than once per second
       with irregular spacing, others are only updated every few seconds.  Instead of
       counting individual alarm events and trying to decide if enough have occured, we
       instead bin the data into buckets of a few seconds worth of data.  In this example
       we have data coming at 1Hz and we bin them into 5 second chunks.

    b) Each input data is compared to a specified alarm condition and flagged green, yellow,
       or red.  The first bin has 5 green reports, the last has 4 green and one red.

    c) For each bin find the worst report and save it.

    a) ddddd|ddddd|ddddd|ddddd|ddddd|ddddd|
     t=0     5     10

    b) ggggg|ggggg|ggYgY|RRRgg|ggggg|ggRgg|
     t=0     5     10

    c)   g     g     Y     R     g     R

        #   only set for gas concentrations, durning the lengthy warm up
        #   phase there will be a number of setData() calls with no matching
        #   keys.
        # 2) Once in measurment mode, periodically the input dict is missing
        #   the concentration key/value pairs.  Or at least that's what it's
        #   doing in the CFADS simulator.  I don't know if this is a bug or
        #   by design, perhaps related to how the scheme is set.  Either way,
        #   the missing concentrations, when that's all the monitors are set
        #   for, causes errors in the monitor counters.
