# FileManager
#
# This class is designed to make creating, closing, and writing to Picarro
# output files easier.
# It is designed to:
#       * Create files with a properly formatted[1] name.
#       * Put the file in the correct date formatted directory.
#       * Create date formatted paths as needed.
#       * Maintain a persistent file handle.
#       * Close the file if a time criteria is met.
#       * Compress and/or move the closed file as needed.
#       * Keep the directory clean by deleting orphaned/empty files.
#
# Outside this class, the API should be simple, just instantiate,
# accept data to write, and close if the analyzer is shutting down or
# there is a state change that requires starting a new file.  Internally
# this class will keep track of the current open file so the external
# code doesn't have to manipulate file handles.
#
# [1]   File names must be unique in a given directory.  Filenames should
#       have an embedded date and incremented counter so that it is easy to
#       spot missing files and the order of the files is obvious. Example
#
#       AMADS_DAT_20170222_0000.txt
#       AMADS_DAT_20170222_0001.txt
#       AMADS_DAT_20170222_0003.txt
#
#       Key:    AMADS - analyzer type, 5 chars
#               DAT - dat file, 3 chars
#               20170222 - file created Feb 02, 2017, 8 chars
#               0000 - file counter, 0000 is the 1stfile, 0001 is 2nd, etc. 4 chars
#               txt - file is plain text, 3 chars extension
#
#       File types: DAT - standard user dat file
#                   PDT - private (Picarro only) dat file
#                   RDF - ringdown file
#                   HLT - long-term health & alarm data
#                   LOG - diagnostics log
